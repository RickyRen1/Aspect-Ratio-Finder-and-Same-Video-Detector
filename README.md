### Design Notes
- Content Similarity: The service uses a two-stage matching algorithm for robust video similarity detection:
  1. **Stage 1 (Hash-based filtering)**: Computes 64-bit pHash (DCT-based perceptual hash) values on up to 25 evenly sampled frames per video. Frames are center-cropped to square format and resized to reduce aspect ratio sensitivity. Videos with hash similarity > 0.50 proceed to stage 2.
  2. **Stage 2 (Keypoint matching)**: Uses ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) keypoint detection and matching on frame thumbnails (128Ã—128 pixels) to verify matches. Keypoint matching is more discriminative and helps distinguish true matches from false positives.
  3. **Combined scoring**: Final similarity combines hash similarity (30% weight) and keypoint similarity (70% weight). True matches (same video, different aspect ratio) should score > 0.85.

- Aspect Ratio Bucketing: Videos are placed into canonical buckets 9:16, 1:1, 4:5, 16:9 within 1% tolerance. If the video does not fit in any bucket then they are placed in `Other`

- In-memory state: Uploaded video metadata, frame hashes, and frame thumbnails for similarity detection are stored in-memory (`videos`, `frame_hash_dict`, `frame_thumbnails_dict`) so restarts will clear state. In order to process video metadata, uploads are written to temporary files which may take more than a minute depending on internet speed.

- Limits: Only `.mp4` is accepted. Videos are sampled at up to 25 frames evenly distributed across the video duration for similarity comparison.
