### Design Notes
- Content Similarity: The service computes 64-bit dHash values on evenly sampled grayscale frames across the video, then compares sets of hashes with a Hamming-distanceâ€“based similarity score in [0, 1]. We return the videos that have a similarity rating greater than 0.6, sorted most to least similar. 0.6 was decided after testing a couple videos so a different value may be more robust.

- Aspect Ratio Bucketing: Videos are placed into canonical buckets 9:16, 1:1, 4:5, 16:9 within 1% tolerance. If the video does not fit in any bucket then they are placed in `Other`

- In-memory state: Uploaded video metadata and frame hashes for checking similar content are stored in-memory (`videos`, `frame_hash_dict`) so restarts will clear state. In order to process video metadata, uploads are written to temporary files which may take more than a minute depending on internet speed.

- Limits: Only `.mp4` is accepted. Very long videos will probably mean fewer sampled frames compared to total video causing similarity to be lower.
